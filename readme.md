# Breakout web-game-app.

# Description
Breakout is an arcade game developed and published by Atari, released on May 13, 1976. In Breakout, a layer of bricks lines the top third of the screen. A ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. When a brick is hit, the ball bounces away and the brick is destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this from happening, the player has a movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play. This version of Breakout was made using JS and it's about POINTS. It was made with one purpose - Fun education. Made for me @denys.havryliv@gmail.com and lads from Eleks Frond End Camp. GL HF.
